       "\"I this 3-miute itroductio, I'm goig\\nto aswer four frequetly asked questios about JavaScript. \\nWhat is JavaScript, what ca you do with it, where does JavaScript code ru ad\\nwhat is the differece betwee JavaScript ad ECMAScript. So let's\\nstart with the first questio. What is JavaScript? JavaScript is oe of the most\\npopular ad widely used programmig laguages i the world right ow. It's\\ngrowig faster tha ay other programmig laguages ad big compaies\\nlike Netflix, Walmart, ad PayPal build etire applicatios aroud JavaScript.\\nAd here's the average salary of a JavaScript developer i the Uited\\nStates. That is $72,000 a year. So it's a great opportuity to get a good\\njob out of learig JavaScript. You ca work as a frot-ed developer or a\\nback-ed developer or a full stack developer who kows both the frot ed\\nad the back ed. Now, the secod questio. What ca you do with JavaScript? For a\\nlog time, javascript was oly used i browsers to\\nbuild iteractive web pages some developers refer to javascript as a toy\\nlaguage but those days are goe because of huge commuity support ad\\nivestmets by large compaies like Facebook ad Google these days you ca\\nbuild full-blow web or mobile apps as well as real time etworkig\\napplicatios like chats ad video streamig services commad-lie tools or\\neve games here's a example a third questio where does JavaScript code ru\\njavascript was origially desiged to ru oly i browsers so every browser\\nhas what we call a JavaScript egie that ca execute JavaScript code for\\nexample the JavaScript egies i firefox ad chrome are SpiderMokey ad\\nv8 i 2009 a very clever egieer called Rya Dahl took the ope-source\\nJavaScript egie i chrome ad embedded it iside a C++ program he called that\\nprogram ode the ode is a C++ program that icludes Google's v8 JavaScript\\negie ow with this we ca ru JavaScript code out\\nof a browser so we ca pass our JavaScript code to ode for executio\\nad this meas with JavaScript we ca build the backed for our web ad mobile\\napplicatios so i a utshell JavaScript code ca be ru iside of a browser or\\ni ode browsers ad ode provide a rutime eviromet for our JavaScript\\ncode ad fially the last questio what is the differece betwee JavaScript ad\\nEggma script well ECMO script is just a specificatio javascript is a\\nprogrammig laguage that cofirms to this specificatio so we have this\\norgaizatio called a comma which is resposible for defiig stadards they\\ntake care of this Eggma script specificatio the first versio of\\nEggma script was released i 1997 the startig from 2015\\nACMA has bee workig o aual releases of a ewest specificatio so i 2015\\nthey released a kimoo script 2015 which is also called ECMO script versio 6 or\\nes6 for short this specificatio defied may ew features for JavaScript alright\\neough theory let's see javascript i actio so every\\nbrowser has a JavaScript egie ad we ca easily write JavaScript code here\\nwithout ay additioal tools of course this is ot how we build real-world\\napplicatios but this is just for a quick demo so ope up Chrome right click\\no a empty area ad go to ispect ow this opes up chrome developer tools\\nhere select the cosole tab this is our JavaScript cosole ad we ca write ay\\nvalid JavaScript code here so type this cosole dot log put a sigle code here\\nad the hello world aother sigle code to termiate close the paretheses ad\\nadd a semicolo at the ed ow as you go through the course you're goig to\\nuderstad exactly what all this meas for ow do't worry about it so ow I'll\\npress ENTER ad you ca see the hello world message o the cosole we ca also\\nwrite mathematical expressios here for example two plus two we get four or we\\nca do somethig like this alert practices sigle coat yo eter ad\\nhere's a alert i the ext lecture I'm goig to talk about settig up your\\ndevelopmet eviromet for writig JavaScript code i order to write javascript code you\\need a code editor there are various code editors out there icludig Visual\\nStudio code or yes code sublime text atom ad so o\\nout of these my favorite is Visual Studio code that you ca dowload from\\ncode that Visual Studio comm it's a very simple lightweight cross-platform ad\\npowerful editor so if you do't have Visual Studio code o your machie go\\nahead ad dowload it the other thig I wated to istall is ote you ca\\ndowload ote from odejs org ow techically you do't\\necessarily eed kow to execute JavaScript because as I explaied before\\nyou ca execute JavaScript code iside of a browser or EdNote but it's good to\\nhave ode o your machie because we use that to istall third-party libraries\\nad also later i this sectio I'm goig to show you a preview of ode so pause\\nthe video ow ad dowload Visual Studio code as well as ote oce you're doe\\ncome back cotiue watchig to create a ew folder call that J s\\ndash basics the ame does't really matter we just wat to have a folder for\\nwritig all the code i this course ow drag ad drop this folder ito visual\\nstudio code okay we've got this folder ope let's add a ew file here idex dot\\nHTML ow you do't really eed to kow HTML i order to take this course but if\\nyou wat to be a frot-ed developer you should kow your HTML well ow i this\\nfile I wat you to type a exclamatio mark ad the press tab this geerates\\nsome basic HTML boilerplate we do't really care about ay of this code here\\nwe're goa use this as a host for our JavaScript code you're goa see that i\\nthe ext lecture so save the chages ow ope the extesios tab here\\nhere i this box search for live server so live server is a very lightweight web\\nserver that we're goig to use to serve our web applicatio so istall this the\\nyou will have to restart Visual Studio code whe you're doe go to the Explorer\\ntab right click idex.html ad select ope with live server this will ope up Chrome or your default\\nbrowser ad poit it to this address that's where our web applicatio is\\nserved from ow curretly we have a empty page ow to make sure that\\neverythig is workig properly let's go back to visual studio code here i the\\nbody sectio let's add a h1 press tab ad type hello world ow save the\\nchages back i the browser we ca see this page is refreshed automatically ad\\nwe've got the hello world headig here i the ext lecture you're goig to\\nwrite your first JavaScript code all right ow we're ready to write our\\nfirst Java Script code i order to write JavaScript code here we eed a script\\nelemet there are two places where we ca add a script elemet we ca add it\\nhere i a head sectio or i the body sectio the best practice is to put the\\nscript elemet at the ed of the body sectio after all the existig elemets\\nso here after h1 I'm goa type script ad press tab this is our script elemet\\now why did I say that as a best practice you should put this script\\nelemet here well there are two reasos for that oe reaso is that the browser\\nparses this file from top to bottom so if you put this script elemet here i\\nthe head sectio you might have a lot of JavaScript code there so your browser\\nmay get busy parsig ad executig that JavaScript code ad it wo't be able to\\nreder the cotet of the page so this will create a bad user experiece your\\nuser looks at your web page it's white or blak while your browser is busy\\nparsig ad executig your JavaScript code so that's reaso 1 the secod\\nreaso is that almost always the code that we have i betwee script elemets\\needs to talk to the elemets o this web page for example we may wat to show\\nor hide some elemets so by addig the code here at the ed of the body sectio\\nwe'll be cofidet that all these elemets are redered by the browser ow\\nthere are exceptios to this rule sometimes you're usig third-party code\\nthat has to be placed i the head sectio but these are exceptios as I\\ntold you before as a best practice you should add your JavaScript code at the\\ned of the body sectio ow here we're goa write the same code that you wrote\\ni the last lecture cosole dot log hello world but we're goig to talk\\nabout this i a little bit more detail what we have here is a statemet a\\nstatemet is a piece of code that expresses a actio to be carried out i\\nthis case we wat to log a message o the cosole all statemets\\ni JavaScript should be termiated by a semicolo what we have here i betwee\\nsigle codes is called a strig a strig is a sequece of\\ncharacters ow i JavaScript we also have this otatio we ca add two\\nslashes ad this represets a comet so here we ca add some descriptio to our\\ncode ad this descriptio is igored by the JavaScript egie it's ot executed\\nit's purely for documetig the code whe you waa explai to other\\ndevelopers why you have writte this code this way you do't explai what the\\ncode does because that should be clear i the code itself so here I do't wat\\nto write somethig like loggig somethig o the cosole that's so\\nobvious i the code right istead we wat to explai why's ad a house so for\\nthis demo I'm just goa add a simple commet this is my first JavaScript code\\now save the chages back i the browser we eed to brig the cosole back up so\\nright click somewhere ad go to ispect or alteratively you ca use a shortcut\\nthat is alt commad a eye o Mac or alt cotrol eye o widows that brigs up\\nthe cosole tab if the cosole tab is ot immediately visible make sure to\\nselect it here ad here you ca see the hello world message ow while we ca easily write javascript\\ncode i betwee the script elemet i a real-world applicatio you have\\nthousads or eve millios of code we do't wat to write all that code i\\nlie here we wat to extract ad separate our JavaScript code from our\\nHTML code let me give you a metaphor thik of your house i your bedroom you\\nhave your bed ad your clothes you do't store your clothes i the kitche this\\nis what we call separatio of cocers we have the same priciple i\\nprogrammig so we wat to separate HTML which is all about cotet from\\nJavaScript which is all about behavior how should your web page behave what\\nshould happe whe we hover our mouse over a give elemet maybe somethig\\nshould pop up maybe somethig should be hidde so we use JavaScript to implemet\\nbehavior so ope up the Explorer widow add a ew file cut i idex the j/s ow\\nback i idex dot HTML cut all this JavaScript code here ad the paste it\\ni idex J s ow i this simple applicatio we have a sigle file a\\nsigle javascript file i a real world applicatio we have hudreds or eve\\nthousads of JavaScript files later i the course you will lear how to combie\\nthese files ito a budle ad serve that budle to the cliet ow save the\\nchages back i idex.html ow that all our JavaScript code is i a separate\\nfile we eed to referece that file here so let's add a attribute here SRC which\\nis short for source ad set it to idex that j/s so this tells the browser that\\nour JavaScript code is ow i idex that is save the chages back i the browser\\nyou ca still see the hello world message ad that cofirms that our code\\nis still workig i the ext lecture we are goig to execute this code i ode so i the last lecture we executed this\\npiece of JavaScript code iside of a browser i this lecture I'm goig to\\nshow you how to ru the same code i ode so I'm assumig that you have\\nistalled ode o your machie if ot head over to ode.js org ad dowload\\nthe latest versio of ode ow if you're o Widows ope up commad prompt if\\nyou're o Mac ope up termial ad head over to the folder you created earlier\\now i this folder we ru ode ad pass the ame of our javascript file that is\\nidex dot JSON c ode is a program that icludes google's v8 JavaScript egie\\nwe ca give it a piece of JavaScript code ad it will execute that code for\\nus just like how we ca execute some JavaScript code i a browser so ode is\\na rutime eviromet for executig JavaScript code ow let me show you a\\ntip here i vs code we have a itegrated termial so you're goa have\\nto explicitly ope up a separate termial widow so here o the top uder\\nthe View meu look we have itegrated termial ote the shortcut here that's\\nthe shortcut for mac ad widows you're goa have a differet shortcut so\\nselect this ad here's our itegrated termial poitig to the same folder\\nwhere we created our files so you do't have to explicitly avigate to this\\nfolder ad here we ca ru ode idexed at j/s as well ow i this course we're\\not goa work with ode aymore because ode is a complex separate topic i fact\\nI have a comprehesive course about ode with 14 hours of cotet so oce you\\nfiish this course if you wat to lear ode you ca always look at my ote\\ncourse well hello it's mahshar thak you for\\nwatchig my javascript tutorial I just wated to quickly let you kow that this\\ntutorial is part of my complete JavaScript course where you ca lear\\nabout all the essetial cocepts i JavaScript the course is packed with\\nlots of exercises ad solutios ad by the ed of watchig the course you will\\nalso receive a certificate of completio i case you're iterested you ca fid a\\nlik i the video descriptio ad if ot that's perfectly fie cotiue watchig\\nas the ext sectio is comig up let's start this sectio by a discussio\\nof variables which are oe of the most fudametal cocepts i JavaScript ad\\nay other programmig laguages i programmig we use a variable to store\\ndata temporarily i a computer's memory so we store our data somewhere ad give\\nthat memory locatio ad ame ad with this ame we ca read the data at the\\ngive locatio i the future here is a metaphor thik of the boxes you use to\\norgaize your stuff you put your stuff i various boxes ad put a label o each\\nbox with this you ca easily fid your stuff right a variable is like a box\\nwhat we put iside the box is the value that we assig to a variable that's the\\ndata ad the label that we put o the box is the ame of our variable ow\\nlet's see this i code so here i idex Jas I'm goa declare a variable ow\\npreviously i the old days before es6 we use the VAR keyword to declare a\\nvariable but there are issues with var as you will fid out later i the course\\nso goig forward from es6 the best practice is to use the lead keyword to\\ndeclare a variable ow we eed to give this variable a ame or a idetifier\\nad this is like the label we put o a box so I'm goa call this ame ad\\nfially we eed to termiate this declaratio with a semicolo ow let's\\nlog this o the cosole ad see what we get\\nso cosole that log ame oce agai we eed to termiate this statemet with a\\nsemicolo save the chages ad here i the cosole we see udefied so by\\ndefault variables that we defied i JavaScript their value is udefied ow\\nwe ca optioally iitialize this variable so I'm goa set this to a\\nstrig which is a sequece of characters like Marsh ote that I'm usig sigle\\nquote you ca also use double quotes differet developers have differet\\nprefereces but it's more commo to use sigle quotes for declarig strigs i\\nJavaScript ow whe we save the chages istead of oe\\nwe see Marsh o the cosole so here i this example we have declared a variable\\ncalled ame ad we have set that to this value to this strig ow we have a few\\nrules for amig these variables here are the rules\\nfirst is that they caot be a reserved keyword so i JavaScript we have\\nreserved keywords let is oe of them you also have if else VAR ad so o ow\\nyou do't have to memorize this list if you try to use oe of these ames you're\\ngoa get a error for example if I chage this to if otice red uderlie\\nthis is idicatig that this is ot a valid idetifier okay so revert it back\\now the secod rule is that they should be meaigful we wat to have meaigful\\names like meaigful labels I've see developers usig ames like a or PE or a\\noe or I do't kow X these variable ames do ot give us ay clue what is\\nthe purpose of these variables what kid of data are restorig at that memory\\nlocatio so always use meaigful ad descriptive ames okay ow back to ame\\nthe third rule is that they caot start with a umber so we caot have a\\nvariable like oe ame but agai goig back to the secod rule why would you\\nwat to call it variable oe ame it's meaigless right so always use\\nmeaigful ames the fourth rule is that they caot cotai a space or - so if\\nyou have multiple words you eed to put them together here is a example let's\\nimagie we wat to declare a variable called first ame so first ame ad ote\\nthat here I'm usig camel otatio so the first letter of the first word\\nshould be lowercase ad the first letter of every word after should be uppercase\\nthis is what we call camel otatio which is the covetio we use i\\nJavaScript to ame our variables aother thig you eed to kow about these\\nvariable ames is they are case-sesitive so if I declare\\naother variable call it first ame but make the F uppercase these two variables\\nare differet but as I told you before if you stick to camel otatio you\\nwould't ed up with a variable ame like this ad fially the last thig you\\need to kow about these variables is that if you wat to declare multiple\\nvariables there are two ways to do this you ca declare them o oe lie ad\\nseparate them usig a comma so first ame ad the last ame ow i this case\\nI have ot iitialized either of these variables they're both udefied I ca\\noptioally iitialize oe or both of them so I ca set this to Marsh ad I\\nca leave last ame udefied or set it to my last ame Hammad o e but the\\nmoder best practice is to declare each variable o a sigle lie so we\\ntermiate this first declaratio with a semicolo ad declare the secod\\nvariable o a ew lie that's the moder best practice ext we're goig to look\\nat costats alright ow let's declare a variable\\ncalled iterest rate so let iterest rate ad we set this to 0.3 ow this is\\nthe iitial value we ca always chage that later so we ca set iterest rate\\nto let's say 1 ow if you log this o the cosole of course we're goig to see\\nthe ew value right so save the chages ad here's oe o the cosole however i\\na real-world applicatio there are situatios that we do't wat the value\\nof a variable to chage because otherwise it's goig to create all kids\\nof bugs i our applicatio i those situatios istead of a variable we use\\na costat so the value of a variable as the ame implies ca chage but the\\nvalue of a costat caot chage so here if we chage let to Cost ow\\niterest rate will be a costat so whe I save the chages you're goig to see\\na error i the cosole o lie 3 where we reassig iterest rate so let's have\\na look save the chages ad here's the error\\nucut type error assigmet 2 costat variable we ca see this error happe i\\nidex dot JSP but if you click here you ca see the\\nlie i code where this error occurred so we caot reassig a costat all\\nright ow back to the cosole so here's the best practice if you do't eed to\\nreassig costat should be your default choice otherwise if you eed to reassig\\na variable use let so you have leared how to declare ad\\niitialize a variable ow you might be woderig what are the kid of values\\nthat we ca assig to a variable well you have see strigs but we have more\\ntypes basically i JavaScript we have two categories of types o oe side we\\nhave primitives also called value types ad the other types we have referece\\ntypes i this lecture we're goig to focus o primitives ad you're goig to\\nlear about referece types later i the course ow i the category of primitives\\nwe have strigs umbers bully eds udefied ad ot let's look at each of\\nthese i actio so here we have a variable called ame which is set to\\nyour strig what we have here is what we call a strig literal that's just a\\nfacy ame for a strig ow let's declare a variable ad set it to a\\number so let H be set back to 30 ad by the way I'm ot 30 years old but do't\\ntell ayoe okay so this is what we call a umber litora\\now let's declare a boolea a boolea ca be either true or false\\nso let is a proved to be true this is what we call a boolea literal ad we\\nuse this i situatios where we wat to have some logic for example if the order\\nis approved the it eeds to be shipped so the value of a boolea variable ca\\nbe true or false ad by the way ote that both true ad false are reserved\\nkeywords so they caot be variable ames ok ow you have see udefied\\nbefore so I ca declare aother variable first ame\\nif we do't iitialize it by default its value is udefied\\nbut we ca also explicitly set this to udefied but that's ot very commo i\\ncotrast we have aother keyword that is ot so let me declare aother variable\\nad set this to o we use ull i situatios where we wat to\\nplease heed me clear the value of variable for example you may wat to\\npreset the user with a list of colors if the user has o selectio you wat to\\nset the selected color variable to kow i the future if the user selects a\\ncolor the we're goig to reassig this variable to a color like red ad the if\\nthey click red agai perhaps we wat to remove the selectio so we set this back\\ntool ot so we use orm i situatios where we wat to clear the value of a\\nvariable so these are the examples of primitives or value types we have\\nstrigs umbers boolea's udefied ad o ow i es6 we have aother primitive\\nthat is symbol ad you're goig to lear about that later i the course oe thig that separates JavaScript from\\na lot of programmig laguages is that javascript is a dyamic laguage what do\\nthey mea by dyamic well we have two types of programmig laguages\\nstatic laguages or dyamic laguages i static laguages whe we declare a\\nvariable the type of that variable is set ad it caot be chaged i the\\nfuture i a dyamic laguage like JavaScript the type of a variable ca\\nchage at rutime let's see this i code so back i the example from the last\\nlecture we have declared this ame variable ad we have set that to your\\nstrig so the type of ame is curretly a strig but it ca chage i the future\\nlet's take a look so here i the cosole we ca execute some JavaScript code we\\nhave this type of operator ad with that we ca check the type of a variable so\\nafter that we add the ame of the variable i this case our ame variable\\nso ote that the type of ame is a strig ow if we reassig ame to a\\ndifferet value like a umber ad check its type look the type is ow chaged to\\na umber this is what we call a dyamic laguage so ulike static laguages the\\ntype of these variables will be determied at rutime based o the\\nvalues that we assiged to them ow let's take a look at a few more examples\\nof the type of operator ad by the way ote that type of is aother reserved\\nkeyword so you caot have a variable called type off so we ca clear the\\ncosole by pressig ctrl + L so ow let's take a look at type of age it's a\\number ow if you chage age to a floatig-poit umber ad I kow it\\ndoes't make sese but let's just stick to this for this example thirty poit\\noe ad the look at type of age it's still a umber so i JavaScript ulike\\nother programmig laguages we do't have two kids of umbers we do't have\\nfloatig-poit umbers ad itegers all umbers are of type umber ow let's\\nlook at the type of he's approved it's a boolea as I told you before what about\\nthe first ame let's have a look type of first ame it's udefied ad that's\\nfuy because the value of this variable is udefied\\nbut this type is also udefied what does this mea well earlier I told you\\nthat we have two categories of types we have primitives or value types ad\\nreferece types i the primitive types category we have strigs umbers boolea\\nudefied ad o so udefied is actually a type but is also a value i\\nthis example because we have set first-ame to udefied as a value it's\\ntype is also udefied okay ow what about selected color let's have a look\\nso type of selected color the type of this variable is a object what is a\\nobject that's the topic for the ext lecture so you have see all the primitive types\\ni JavaScript ow let's take a look at the referece types i the referece\\ntypes category we have objects arrays ad fuctios i this lecture we're\\ngoig to explore objects ad you will lear about arrays ad fuctios later\\ni this sectio so what is a object a object i JavaScript ad other\\nprogrammig laguages is like a object i real life thik of a perso a perso\\nhas ame age address ad so o these are the properties of a perso you have the\\nsame cocept i JavaScript so whe we're dealig with multiple related variables\\nwe ca put these variables iside of a object for example here we have two\\nvariables ame ad age they're highly related they are part of the\\nrepresetatio of a perso so istead of declarig two variables we ca declare a\\nperso object ad the istead of referecig these two differet\\nvariables we ca just referece the perso object\\nit makes our code cleaer so let's see how we ca declare a perso object we\\nstart with let or Cost if we do't wat to reassig the perso object ad set it\\nto a object literal so this sytax we have here these curly braces is what we\\ncall a object literal ow betwee these curly braces we add oe or more key\\nvalue pairs so the keys are what we call the properties of this object i this\\ncase we wat this perso object to have two properties or two keys ame ad age\\nso we add ame here that's the key the we add a colo ad after that we set the\\nvalue so maash ow we add a comma ad add aother key value pair age 30 so ow\\nwe have a perso object with two properties or two key value pairs ame\\nad age ad with that we do't eed these two variables ow this lock perso\\no the cosole so that log perso save the chages so\\nhere's our persoal object agai ote the object literal sytax so we have\\ncurly braces ad i betwee them we have oe or more key value pairs ad these\\nare the properties of the persoal object ow there are two ways to work\\nwith these properties let's say we wat to chage the ame of this perso so we\\need to access the ame property there are two ways the first way is what we\\ncall the dot otatio so we add the ame of our object i this case perso dot\\now you ca see its properties we have age ad ame so we ca chage the value\\nof ame to Joh ow we ca use the dot otatio to also read the value of a\\nproperty so here o lie 10 istead of logi the perso object we ca log its\\name property save the chages ad i the cosole we get Joh the other way to\\naccess a property is usig bracket otatio so bracket otatio so istead\\nof dot we use square brackets ad we pass a strig that determies the ame\\nof the target property so sigle or double quotes\\nbut sigle quotes are more commo the ame of the target property is ame so\\nwe ca chage that to a same Mary agai whe readig that we ca use the dot\\notatio or the bracket otatio if we save the chages ow we get Mary o the\\ncosole ow you might be askig which approach is better dot otatio or\\nbracket otatio well as you ca see dot otatio is a bit more cocise it's\\nshorter so that should be your default choice however bracket otatio has its\\now users sometimes you do't kow the ame of the target property util the\\nrutime for example i our user iterface the user might be selectig\\nthe ame of the target property i that case at the time of writig code we\\ndo't kow what property we're goig to access that is\\ngoig to be selected at rutime by the user so we might have aother variable\\nsomewhere else like selectio that determies the ame of the target\\nproperty that the user is selectig ad that ca chage at rutime with this we\\nca access that property usig the bracket otatio i a dyamic way so we\\npass selectio here ad we get the same result okay ow if this is cofusig\\ndo't worry you're goig to see this agai i the future as you gai more\\nexperiece with JavaScript for ow just stick to the dot otatio because that's\\ncleaer ad easier ext we're goig to look at arrays sometimes i your applicatios you might\\nbe dealig with a list of objects for example the list of products i a\\nshoppig cart or the list of colors the user has selected i situatios like\\nthat you use a array to store that list let me show you how so here I'm goa\\ndeclare aother variable called selected colors ote that I'm usig a meaigful\\name I do't have SC or some other weird ame selected colors ow we ca\\niitialize this ad set it to a empty array so these square brackets are what\\nwe call array literal ad they idicate a empty array ow we ca iitialize\\nthis array ad add a couple of items like red ad blue let's Lock this o the\\ncosole so cosole the log selected colors save the chages so here's our\\narray with two elemets we ca expad that ote that each elemet has a idex\\nad that determies the positio of that elemet i the array so the idex of the\\nfirst elemet is zero ad the idex of the secod elemet is oe so if you wat\\nto access a elemet i a array we use this idex here's how for example let's\\nsay you wat to display the first elemet i this array you use the square\\nbrackets ad the specify the idex save the chages ad ow we have red ow\\nearlier I told you that JavaScript is a dyamic laguage so the type of\\nvariables ca chage at rutime the same priciple applies to our arrays so the\\nlegths of arrays as well as the type of objects we have i a array are dyamic\\nthey ca chage so aliged - we iitialize this array with two elemets\\nright ow o lie 3 we ca add aother elemet to this array so the array will\\nexpad so let's say selected colors of 2 that meas the third item i this array\\nis goig to be gree ow let's display this array o the cosole\\nso we have a array with three elemets so the legth is dyamic it ca chage\\nalso the type of objects we have i this array is dyamic so ulike other\\nprogrammig laguages where every item or every object i the array should have\\nthe same type i JavaScript we ca store differet types i a array so we ca\\nmake the last elemet a umber save the chages ow we have two strigs ad a\\number so the objects i the array as well as the size of the array are\\ndyamic ow techically a array is a object so just like the persoal object\\nwe defied i the last lecture it has a buch of key value pairs or properties\\nthat we ca access usig the dot otatio let me prove that to you so\\nhere o the cosole let's look at the type of selected colors so the type of\\nthis array is a object so a array is a object i JavaScript so here o lie\\n4 we ca look at the properties of this array or this object usig the dot\\notatio look these are all the properties defied i arrays i\\nJavaScript so every time we declare a array usig square brackets that array\\nwill automatically receive these properties we did't explicitly defie\\nthem they're just somehow magically iherited from somewhere else we're\\ngoig to lear about that later whe we talk about prototypes ow i this\\nlecture we're goig to look at oe of these properties that is the legth\\nproperty this property returs the umber of items or elemets i a array\\nso save the chages you ca see we have three elemets i this array ow later\\ni the course we have a comprehesive sectio about arrays you'll lear about\\nall kids of operatios we ca perform o arrays for ow all I wat you to take\\naway is that a array is a data structure that we use to represet a\\nlist of items i the category of referece types you\\nhave leared about objects ad arrays ow let's take a look at fuctios\\nfuctios are oe of the fudametal buildig blocks i JavaScript a fuctio\\nis basically a set of statemets that performs a task or calculates a value\\nlet me show you a couple of examples so I'm goig to declare a fuctio usig\\nthe fuctio keyword ow we eed to give it a ame let's call that greet after\\nthat we eed to add paretheses that's part of the sytax for declarig\\nfuctios ad the curly braces ow what we have here iside the curly braces is\\nwhat we refer to as the body of this fuctio ad this is where we add all\\nthese statemets to defie some kid of logic i our applicatio for example the\\nlogic for this fuctio should be to display a message o the cosole so here\\nwe ca add cosole the log hello world ow ote that here we have a statemet\\nso we termiated with a semicolo but whe we are declarig a fuctio we\\ndo't eed to add semicolo at the ed because we are ot declarig it like a\\nvariable like this okay this is a fuctio declaratio right so ow we\\nhave a fuctio we ca call this fuctio like this so we add the ame of\\nthe fuctio ad paretheses agai ad the semicolo to idicate that this is\\na statemet save the chages ow we have hello world o the cosole but that's\\npretty borig what would we do this let me show you how to make this more\\niterestig our fuctios ca have iputs ad these iputs ca chage how\\nthe fuctio behaves so let's say istead of displayig hello world we\\nwat to display the ame of the perso here like hello Joh so we ca add a\\nvariable here i betwee paretheses we refer to this variable as a parameter\\nso this greet fuctio has oe parameter called ame ad essetially ame is like\\na variable that is oly meaigful iside\\ndysfuctio so iside of this fuctio we ca work with this ame variable but\\nit will ot be accessible outside of this fuctio the ame is a iput to\\nthis fuctio so istead of displayig hello world we ca display hello\\nthe add a plus here to cocateate two strigs so we ca add ame after ow\\nwhe callig the great fuctio we eed to pass a value for the ame variable or\\name parameter more accurately so we ca pass Joh here ow we refer to this as\\na argumet so Joh is a argumet to the greet fuctio a ame is a parameter\\nof the greet fuctio it's oe of the thigs that a lot of programmers do't\\nkow they do't kow the differece betwee a parameter ad a argumet so a\\nparameter is what we have here at the time of declaratio but the argumet is\\nthe actual value with supply for that parameter okay\\now let's save the chages so we have hello Joh ow we ca reuse this\\nfuctio but with a differet iput so we ca copy this lie here ad chage o\\nto Mary save the chages ow we have two differet messages o the cosole ow a\\nfuctio ca have multiple parameters so here we ca separate parameters usig a\\ncomma so let's add aother parameter like last ame ow we ca chage our\\ncosole ot blog add a space here ad the display the last ame\\now whe callig this great fuctio we should pass aother argumet for the\\nlast ame right but let's see what happes if we do't do this so I'm goa\\nsave the chages see what we got hello Joh udefied\\nbecause as I told you before the default value of variables i JavaScript is\\nudefied so because we did ot pass a value for the last ame by default it's\\nudefied so I'm goa pass aother argumet here we separate them usig a\\ncomma Joh Smith ad we do't eed the secod call to the\\ngreet fuctio save the chages ow we have hello Joh Smith ow there is a cleaer way to write this\\ncode o lie three all these cocateatios are kid of\\nugly they're gettig i the way later i the course I'll show you how to use\\ntemplate literals to clea up this code for ow do't worry about it let's look\\nat aother example of a fuctio so this fuctio we have here is performig a\\ntask so performig a task is task is to display somethig o the cosole but\\nsometimes our fuctios might calculate somethig so here is a example of a\\nfuctio that calculates a value so agai fuctio let's call this fuctio\\nsquare this fuctio should take a parameter let's call that umber ow we\\need to calculate the square of that umber that is umber times umber just\\nbasic math right ow we eed to retur this value to whoever is callig this\\nfuctio for that we use the retur keyword that's aother reserved keyword\\nso you caot have a variable called retur okay ow istead of callig the\\ngreet fuctio let's call the square fuctio so square we pass two ow this\\nreturs a value so we ca use that value to iitialize a variable for example we\\nca declare aother variable called umber ad set it to a square of 2 ad\\nthe we ca display that o the cosole save the chages so we get 4 ow i this\\nparticular example we do't ecessarily have to declare a separate variable if\\nall we wat to do is to display the square of 2 o the cosole we ca\\nexclude this variable declaratio ad simply pass square of 2 to cosole.log\\nso whe the JavaScript egie execute this code first is goig to call this\\nfuctio it would get a value ad the pass that value to cosole dot lock\\nlet's save the chages ad look we still get 4 ow I have a questio for you how\\nmay fuctio calls do you thik we have i this code we have to fuctio costs\\nsquare of two is oe fuctio call let me delete this temporarily but cosult\\nthat lock is also aother fuctio call right because here we have paretheses\\nso recallig the log fuctio which is defied somewhere ad passig a\\nargumet we ca pass a simple strig like hello or we ca pass a expressio\\nthat expressio ca be a call to aother fuctio like square of two okay so this\\nis the basics of fuctios agai later i the course we have a comprehesive\\nsectio about fuctios for ow all I wat you to take away is that a fuctio\\nis a set of statemets that either performs a task or calculate ad returs\\na value a real world applicatio is essetially a collectio of hudreds or\\nthousads of fuctios workig together to provide the fuctioality of that\\napplicatio hi there it's me mosh agai you seem to\\nbe very ethusiastic about learig JavaScript so I wat to cogratulate you\\nfor your determiatio for learig if you wat to lear more from me I highly\\necourage you to eroll i my JavaScript course you ca watch this course olie\\nor offlie as may times as you wat at your ow pace the course comes with\\nplety of exercises ad solutios ad you will also receive a certificate of\\ncompletio by the ed of watchig the course i case you're iterested the\\nlik is i the video descriptio have a great day ad I hope to see you i the\\ncourse\""
