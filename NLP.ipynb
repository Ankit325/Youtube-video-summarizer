       "\"In this 3-minute introduction, I'm going\\nto answer four frequently asked questions about JavaScript. \\nWhat is JavaScript, what can you do with it, where does JavaScript code run and\\nwhat is the difference between JavaScript and ECMAScript. So let's\\nstart with the first question. What is JavaScript? JavaScript is one of the most\\npopular and widely used programming languages in the world right now. It's\\ngrowing faster than any other programming languages and big companies\\nlike Netflix, Walmart, and PayPal build entire applications around JavaScript.\\nAnd here's the average salary of a JavaScript developer in the United\\nStates. That is $72,000 a year. So it's a great opportunity to get a good\\njob out of learning JavaScript. You can work as a front-end developer or a\\nback-end developer or a full stack developer who knows both the front end\\nand the back end. Now, the second question. What can you do with JavaScript? For a\\nlong time, javascript was only used in browsers to\\nbuild interactive web pages some developers refer to javascript as a toy\\nlanguage but those days are gone because of huge community support and\\ninvestments by large companies like Facebook and Google these days you can\\nbuild full-blown web or mobile apps as well as real time networking\\napplications like chats and video streaming services command-line tools or\\neven games here's an example a third question where does JavaScript code run\\njavascript was originally designed to run only in browsers so every browser\\nhas what we call a JavaScript engine that can execute JavaScript code for\\nexample the JavaScript engines in firefox and chrome are SpiderMonkey and\\nv8 in 2009 a very clever engineer called Ryan Dahl took the open-source\\nJavaScript engine in chrome and embedded it inside a C++ program he called that\\nprogram node the node is a C++ program that includes Google's v8 JavaScript\\nengine now with this we can run JavaScript code out\\nof a browser so we can pass our JavaScript code to node for execution\\nand this means with JavaScript we can build the backend for our web and mobile\\napplications so in a nutshell JavaScript code can be run inside of a browser or\\nin node browsers and node provide a runtime environment for our JavaScript\\ncode and finally the last question what is the difference between JavaScript and\\nEggman script well ECMO script is just a specification javascript is a\\nprogramming language that confirms to this specification so we have this\\norganization called a comma which is responsible for defining standards they\\ntake care of this Eggman script specification the first version of\\nEggman script was released in 1997 then starting from 2015\\nACMA has been working on annual releases of a newest specification so in 2015\\nthey released a kimono script 2015 which is also called ECMO script version 6 or\\nes6 for short this specification defined many new features for JavaScript alright\\nenough theory let's see javascript in action so every\\nbrowser has a JavaScript engine and we can easily write JavaScript code here\\nwithout any additional tools of course this is not how we build real-world\\napplications but this is just for a quick demo so open up Chrome right click\\non an empty area and go to inspect now this opens up chrome developer tools\\nhere select the console tab this is our JavaScript console and we can write any\\nvalid JavaScript code here so type this console dot log put a single code here\\nand then hello world another single code to terminate close the parentheses and\\nadd a semicolon at the end now as you go through the course you're going to\\nunderstand exactly what all this means for now don't worry about it so now I'll\\npress ENTER and you can see the hello world message on the console we can also\\nwrite mathematical expressions here for example two plus two we get four or we\\ncan do something like this alert practices single coat yo enter and\\nhere's an alert in the next lecture I'm going to talk about setting up your\\ndevelopment environment for writing JavaScript code in order to write javascript code you\\nneed a code editor there are various code editors out there including Visual\\nStudio code or yes code sublime text atom and so on\\nout of these my favorite is Visual Studio code that you can download from\\ncode that Visual Studio comm it's a very simple lightweight cross-platform and\\npowerful editor so if you don't have Visual Studio code on your machine go\\nahead and download it the other thing I wanted to install is note you can\\ndownload note from nodejs org now technically you don't\\nnecessarily need know to execute JavaScript because as I explained before\\nyou can execute JavaScript code inside of a browser or EndNote but it's good to\\nhave node on your machine because we use that to install third-party libraries\\nand also later in this section I'm going to show you a preview of node so pause\\nthe video now and download Visual Studio code as well as note once you're done\\ncome back continue watching to create a new folder call that J s\\ndash basics the name doesn't really matter we just want to have a folder for\\nwriting all the code in this course now drag and drop this folder into visual\\nstudio code okay we've got this folder open let's add a new file here index dot\\nHTML now you don't really need to know HTML in order to take this course but if\\nyou want to be a front-end developer you should know your HTML well now in this\\nfile I want you to type an exclamation mark and then press tab this generates\\nsome basic HTML boilerplate we don't really care about any of this code here\\nwe're gonna use this as a host for our JavaScript code you're gonna see that in\\nthe next lecture so save the changes now open the extensions tab here\\nhere in this box search for live server so live server is a very lightweight web\\nserver that we're going to use to serve our web application so install this then\\nyou will have to restart Visual Studio code when you're done go to the Explorer\\ntab right click index.html and select open with live server this will open up Chrome or your default\\nbrowser and point it to this address that's where our web application is\\nserved from now currently we have an empty page now to make sure that\\neverything is working properly let's go back to visual studio code here in the\\nbody section let's add an h1 press tab and type hello world now save the\\nchanges back in the browser we can see this page is refreshed automatically and\\nwe've got the hello world heading here in the next lecture you're going to\\nwrite your first JavaScript code all right now we're ready to write our\\nfirst Java Script code in order to write JavaScript code here we need a script\\nelement there are two places where we can add a script element we can add it\\nhere in a head section or in the body section the best practice is to put the\\nscript element at the end of the body section after all the existing elements\\nso here after h1 I'm gonna type script and press tab this is our script element\\nnow why did I say that as a best practice you should put this script\\nelement here well there are two reasons for that one reason is that the browser\\nparses this file from top to bottom so if you put this script element here in\\nthe head section you might have a lot of JavaScript code there so your browser\\nmay get busy parsing and executing that JavaScript code and it won't be able to\\nrender the content of the page so this will create a bad user experience your\\nuser looks at your web page it's white or blank while your browser is busy\\nparsing and executing your JavaScript code so that's reason 1 the second\\nreason is that almost always the code that we have in between script elements\\nneeds to talk to the elements on this web page for example we may want to show\\nor hide some elements so by adding the code here at the end of the body section\\nwe'll be confident that all these elements are rendered by the browser now\\nthere are exceptions to this rule sometimes you're using third-party code\\nthat has to be placed in the head section but these are exceptions as I\\ntold you before as a best practice you should add your JavaScript code at the\\nend of the body section now here we're gonna write the same code that you wrote\\nin the last lecture console dot log hello world but we're going to talk\\nabout this in a little bit more detail what we have here is a statement a\\nstatement is a piece of code that expresses an action to be carried out in\\nthis case we want to log a message on the console all statements\\nin JavaScript should be terminated by a semicolon what we have here in between\\nsingle codes is called a string a string is a sequence of\\ncharacters now in JavaScript we also have this notation we can add two\\nslashes and this represents a comet so here we can add some description to our\\ncode and this description is ignored by the JavaScript engine it's not executed\\nit's purely for documenting the code when you wanna explain to other\\ndevelopers why you have written this code this way you don't explain what the\\ncode does because that should be clear in the code itself so here I don't want\\nto write something like logging something on the console that's so\\nobvious in the code right instead we want to explain why's and a house so for\\nthis demo I'm just gonna add a simple comment this is my first JavaScript code\\nnow save the changes back in the browser we need to bring the console back up so\\nright click somewhere and go to inspect or alternatively you can use a shortcut\\nthat is alt command an eye on Mac or alt control eye on windows that brings up\\nthe console tab if the console tab is not immediately visible make sure to\\nselect it here and here you can see the hello world message now while we can easily write javascript\\ncode in between the script element in a real-world application you have\\nthousands or even millions of code we don't want to write all that code in\\nline here we want to extract and separate our JavaScript code from our\\nHTML code let me give you a metaphor think of your house in your bedroom you\\nhave your bed and your clothes you don't store your clothes in the kitchen this\\nis what we call separation of concerns we have the same principle in\\nprogramming so we want to separate HTML which is all about content from\\nJavaScript which is all about behavior how should your web page behave what\\nshould happen when we hover our mouse over a given element maybe something\\nshould pop up maybe something should be hidden so we use JavaScript to implement\\nbehavior so open up the Explorer window add a new file cut in index the j/s now\\nback in index dot HTML cut all this JavaScript code here and then paste it\\nin index J s now in this simple application we have a single file a\\nsingle javascript file in a real world application we have hundreds or even\\nthousands of JavaScript files later in the course you will learn how to combine\\nthese files into a bundle and serve that bundle to the client now save the\\nchanges back in index.html now that all our JavaScript code is in a separate\\nfile we need to reference that file here so let's add an attribute here SRC which\\nis short for source and set it to index that j/s so this tells the browser that\\nour JavaScript code is now in index that is save the changes back in the browser\\nyou can still see the hello world message and that confirms that our code\\nis still working in the next lecture we are going to execute this code in node so in the last lecture we executed this\\npiece of JavaScript code inside of a browser in this lecture I'm going to\\nshow you how to run the same code in node so I'm assuming that you have\\ninstalled node on your machine if not head over to node.js org and download\\nthe latest version of node now if you're on Windows open up command prompt if\\nyou're on Mac open up terminal and head over to the folder you created earlier\\nnow in this folder we run node and pass the name of our javascript file that is\\nindex dot JSON c node is a program that includes google's v8 JavaScript engine\\nwe can give it a piece of JavaScript code and it will execute that code for\\nus just like how we can execute some JavaScript code in a browser so node is\\na runtime environment for executing JavaScript code now let me show you a\\ntip here in vs code we have an integrated terminal so you're gonna have\\nto explicitly open up a separate terminal window so here on the top under\\nthe View menu look we have integrated terminal note the shortcut here that's\\nthe shortcut for mac and windows you're gonna have a different shortcut so\\nselect this and here's our integrated terminal pointing to the same folder\\nwhere we created our files so you don't have to explicitly navigate to this\\nfolder and here we can run node indexed at j/s as well now in this course we're\\nnot gonna work with node anymore because node is a complex separate topic in fact\\nI have a comprehensive course about node with 14 hours of content so once you\\nfinish this course if you want to learn node you can always look at my note\\ncourse well hello it's mahshar thank you for\\nwatching my javascript tutorial I just wanted to quickly let you know that this\\ntutorial is part of my complete JavaScript course where you can learn\\nabout all the essential concepts in JavaScript the course is packed with\\nlots of exercises and solutions and by the end of watching the course you will\\nalso receive a certificate of completion in case you're interested you can find a\\nlink in the video description and if not that's perfectly fine continue watching\\nas the next section is coming up let's start this section by a discussion\\nof variables which are one of the most fundamental concepts in JavaScript and\\nany other programming languages in programming we use a variable to store\\ndata temporarily in a computer's memory so we store our data somewhere and give\\nthat memory location and name and with this name we can read the data at the\\ngiven location in the future here is a metaphor think of the boxes you use to\\norganize your stuff you put your stuff in various boxes and put a label on each\\nbox with this you can easily find your stuff right a variable is like a box\\nwhat we put inside the box is the value that we assign to a variable that's the\\ndata and the label that we put on the box is the name of our variable now\\nlet's see this in code so here in index Jas I'm gonna declare a variable now\\npreviously in the old days before es6 we use the VAR keyword to declare a\\nvariable but there are issues with var as you will find out later in the course\\nso going forward from es6 the best practice is to use the lead keyword to\\ndeclare a variable now we need to give this variable a name or an identifier\\nand this is like the label we put on a box so I'm gonna call this name and\\nfinally we need to terminate this declaration with a semicolon now let's\\nlog this on the console and see what we get\\nso console that log name once again we need to terminate this statement with a\\nsemicolon save the changes and here in the console we see undefined so by\\ndefault variables that we defined in JavaScript their value is undefined now\\nwe can optionally initialize this variable so I'm gonna set this to a\\nstring which is a sequence of characters like Marsh note that I'm using single\\nquote you can also use double quotes different developers have different\\npreferences but it's more common to use single quotes for declaring strings in\\nJavaScript now when we save the changes instead of one\\nwe see Marsh on the console so here in this example we have declared a variable\\ncalled name and we have set that to this value to this string now we have a few\\nrules for naming these variables here are the rules\\nfirst is that they cannot be a reserved keyword so in JavaScript we have\\nreserved keywords let is one of them you also have if else VAR and so on now\\nyou don't have to memorize this list if you try to use one of these names you're\\ngonna get an error for example if I change this to if notice red underline\\nthis is indicating that this is not a valid identifier okay so revert it back\\nnow the second rule is that they should be meaningful we want to have meaningful\\nnames like meaningful labels I've seen developers using names like a or PE or a\\none or I don't know X these variable names do not give us any clue what is\\nthe purpose of these variables what kind of data are restoring at that memory\\nlocation so always use meaningful and descriptive names okay now back to name\\nthe third rule is that they cannot start with a number so we cannot have a\\nvariable like one name but again going back to the second rule why would you\\nwant to call it variable one name it's meaningless right so always use\\nmeaningful names the fourth rule is that they cannot contain a space or - so if\\nyou have multiple words you need to put them together here is an example let's\\nimagine we want to declare a variable called first name so first name and note\\nthat here I'm using camel notation so the first letter of the first word\\nshould be lowercase and the first letter of every word after should be uppercase\\nthis is what we call camel notation which is the convention we use in\\nJavaScript to name our variables another thing you need to know about these\\nvariable names is they are case-sensitive so if I declare\\nanother variable call it first name but make the F uppercase these two variables\\nare different but as I told you before if you stick to camel notation you\\nwouldn't end up with a variable name like this and finally the last thing you\\nneed to know about these variables is that if you want to declare multiple\\nvariables there are two ways to do this you can declare them on one line and\\nseparate them using a comma so first name and then last name now in this case\\nI have not initialized either of these variables they're both undefined I can\\noptionally initialize one or both of them so I can set this to Marsh and I\\ncan leave last name undefined or set it to my last name Hammad on e but the\\nmodern best practice is to declare each variable on a single line so we\\nterminate this first declaration with a semicolon and declare the second\\nvariable on a new line that's the modern best practice next we're going to look\\nat constants alright now let's declare a variable\\ncalled interest rate so let interest rate and we set this to 0.3 now this is\\nthe initial value we can always change that later so we can set interest rate\\nto let's say 1 now if you log this on the console of course we're going to see\\nthe new value right so save the changes and here's one on the console however in\\na real-world application there are situations that we don't want the value\\nof a variable to change because otherwise it's going to create all kinds\\nof bugs in our application in those situations instead of a variable we use\\na constant so the value of a variable as the name implies can change but the\\nvalue of a constant cannot change so here if we change let to Const now\\ninterest rate will be a constant so when I save the changes you're going to see\\nan error in the console on line 3 where we reassign interest rate so let's have\\na look save the changes and here's the error\\nuncut type error assignment 2 constant variable we can see this error happen in\\nindex dot JSP but if you click here you can see the\\nline in code where this error occurred so we cannot reassign a constant all\\nright now back to the console so here's the best practice if you don't need to\\nreassign constant should be your default choice otherwise if you need to reassign\\na variable use let so you have learned how to declare and\\ninitialize a variable now you might be wondering what are the kind of values\\nthat we can assign to a variable well you have seen strings but we have more\\ntypes basically in JavaScript we have two categories of types on one side we\\nhave primitives also called value types and the other types we have reference\\ntypes in this lecture we're going to focus on primitives and you're going to\\nlearn about reference types later in the course now in the category of primitives\\nwe have strings numbers bully ends undefined and not let's look at each of\\nthese in action so here we have a variable called name which is set to\\nyour string what we have here is what we call a string literal that's just a\\nfancy name for a string now let's declare a variable and set it to a\\nnumber so let H be set back to 30 and by the way I'm not 30 years old but don't\\ntell anyone okay so this is what we call a number litora\\nnow let's declare a boolean a boolean can be either true or false\\nso let is a proved to be true this is what we call a boolean literal and we\\nuse this in situations where we want to have some logic for example if the order\\nis approved then it needs to be shipped so the value of a boolean variable can\\nbe true or false and by the way note that both true and false are reserved\\nkeywords so they cannot be variable names ok now you have seen undefined\\nbefore so I can declare another variable first name\\nif we don't initialize it by default its value is undefined\\nbut we can also explicitly set this to undefined but that's not very common in\\ncontrast we have another keyword that is not so let me declare another variable\\nand set this to no we use null in situations where we want to\\nplease heed me clear the value of variable for example you may want to\\npresent the user with a list of colors if the user has no selection you want to\\nset the selected color variable to know in the future if the user selects a\\ncolor then we're going to reassign this variable to a color like red and then if\\nthey click red again perhaps we want to remove the selection so we set this back\\ntool not so we use norm in situations where we want to clear the value of a\\nvariable so these are the examples of primitives or value types we have\\nstrings numbers boolean's undefined and no now in es6 we have another primitive\\nthat is symbol and you're going to learn about that later in the course one thing that separates JavaScript from\\na lot of programming languages is that javascript is a dynamic language what do\\nthey mean by dynamic well we have two types of programming languages\\nstatic languages or dynamic languages in static languages when we declare a\\nvariable the type of that variable is set and it cannot be changed in the\\nfuture in a dynamic language like JavaScript the type of a variable can\\nchange at runtime let's see this in code so back in the example from the last\\nlecture we have declared this name variable and we have set that to your\\nstring so the type of name is currently a string but it can change in the future\\nlet's take a look so here in the console we can execute some JavaScript code we\\nhave this type of operator and with that we can check the type of a variable so\\nafter that we add the name of the variable in this case our name variable\\nso note that the type of name is a string now if we reassign name to a\\ndifferent value like a number and check its type look the type is now changed to\\na number this is what we call a dynamic language so unlike static languages the\\ntype of these variables will be determined at runtime based on the\\nvalues that we assigned to them now let's take a look at a few more examples\\nof the type of operator and by the way note that type of is another reserved\\nkeyword so you cannot have a variable called type off so we can clear the\\nconsole by pressing ctrl + L so now let's take a look at type of age it's a\\nnumber now if you change age to a floating-point number and I know it\\ndoesn't make sense but let's just stick to this for this example thirty point\\none and then look at type of age it's still a number so in JavaScript unlike\\nother programming languages we don't have two kinds of numbers we don't have\\nfloating-point numbers and integers all numbers are of type number now let's\\nlook at the type of he's approved it's a boolean as I told you before what about\\nthe first name let's have a look type of first name it's undefined and that's\\nfunny because the value of this variable is undefined\\nbut this type is also undefined what does this mean well earlier I told you\\nthat we have two categories of types we have primitives or value types and\\nreference types in the primitive types category we have strings numbers boolean\\nundefined and no so undefined is actually a type but is also a value in\\nthis example because we have set first-name to undefined as a value it's\\ntype is also undefined okay now what about selected color let's have a look\\nso type of selected color the type of this variable is an object what is an\\nobject that's the topic for the next lecture so you have seen all the primitive types\\nin JavaScript now let's take a look at the reference types in the reference\\ntypes category we have objects arrays and functions in this lecture we're\\ngoing to explore objects and you will learn about arrays and functions later\\nin this section so what is an object an object in JavaScript and other\\nprogramming languages is like an object in real life think of a person a person\\nhas name age address and so on these are the properties of a person you have the\\nsame concept in JavaScript so when we're dealing with multiple related variables\\nwe can put these variables inside of an object for example here we have two\\nvariables name and age they're highly related they are part of the\\nrepresentation of a person so instead of declaring two variables we can declare a\\nperson object and then instead of referencing these two different\\nvariables we can just reference the person object\\nit makes our code cleaner so let's see how we can declare a person object we\\nstart with let or Const if we don't want to reassign the person object and set it\\nto an object literal so this syntax we have here these curly braces is what we\\ncall an object literal now between these curly braces we add one or more key\\nvalue pairs so the keys are what we call the properties of this object in this\\ncase we want this person object to have two properties or two keys name and age\\nso we add name here that's the key then we add a colon and after that we set the\\nvalue so maash now we add a comma and add another key value pair age 30 so now\\nwe have a person object with two properties or two key value pairs name\\nand age and with that we don't need these two variables now this lock person\\non the console so that log person save the changes so\\nhere's our personal object again note the object literal syntax so we have\\ncurly braces and in between them we have one or more key value pairs and these\\nare the properties of the personal object now there are two ways to work\\nwith these properties let's say we want to change the name of this person so we\\nneed to access the name property there are two ways the first way is what we\\ncall the dot notation so we add the name of our object in this case person dot\\nnow you can see its properties we have age and name so we can change the value\\nof name to John now we can use the dot notation to also read the value of a\\nproperty so here on line 10 instead of login the person object we can log its\\nname property save the changes and in the console we get John the other way to\\naccess a property is using bracket notation so bracket notation so instead\\nof dot we use square brackets and we pass a string that determines the name\\nof the target property so single or double quotes\\nbut single quotes are more common the name of the target property is name so\\nwe can change that to a same Mary again when reading that we can use the dot\\nnotation or the bracket notation if we save the changes now we get Mary on the\\nconsole now you might be asking which approach is better dot notation or\\nbracket notation well as you can see dot notation is a bit more concise it's\\nshorter so that should be your default choice however bracket notation has its\\nown users sometimes you don't know the name of the target property until the\\nruntime for example in our user interface the user might be selecting\\nthe name of the target property in that case at the time of writing code we\\ndon't know what property we're going to access that is\\ngoing to be selected at runtime by the user so we might have another variable\\nsomewhere else like selection that determines the name of the target\\nproperty that the user is selecting and that can change at runtime with this we\\ncan access that property using the bracket notation in a dynamic way so we\\npass selection here and we get the same result okay now if this is confusing\\ndon't worry you're going to see this again in the future as you gain more\\nexperience with JavaScript for now just stick to the dot notation because that's\\ncleaner and easier next we're going to look at arrays sometimes in your applications you might\\nbe dealing with a list of objects for example the list of products in a\\nshopping cart or the list of colors the user has selected in situations like\\nthat you use an array to store that list let me show you how so here I'm gonna\\ndeclare another variable called selected colors note that I'm using a meaningful\\nname I don't have SC or some other weird name selected colors now we can\\ninitialize this and set it to an empty array so these square brackets are what\\nwe call array literal and they indicate an empty array now we can initialize\\nthis array and add a couple of items like red and blue let's Lock this on the\\nconsole so console the log selected colors save the changes so here's our\\narray with two elements we can expand that note that each element has an index\\nand that determines the position of that element in the array so the index of the\\nfirst element is zero and the index of the second element is one so if you want\\nto access an element in an array we use this index here's how for example let's\\nsay you want to display the first element in this array you use the square\\nbrackets and then specify the index save the changes and now we have red now\\nearlier I told you that JavaScript is a dynamic language so the type of\\nvariables can change at runtime the same principle applies to our arrays so the\\nlengths of arrays as well as the type of objects we have in an array are dynamic\\nthey can change so aligned - we initialize this array with two elements\\nright now on line 3 we can add another element to this array so the array will\\nexpand so let's say selected colors of 2 that means the third item in this array\\nis going to be green now let's display this array on the console\\nso we have an array with three elements so the length is dynamic it can change\\nalso the type of objects we have in this array is dynamic so unlike other\\nprogramming languages where every item or every object in the array should have\\nthe same type in JavaScript we can store different types in an array so we can\\nmake the last element a number save the changes now we have two strings and a\\nnumber so the objects in the array as well as the size of the array are\\ndynamic now technically an array is an object so just like the personal object\\nwe defined in the last lecture it has a bunch of key value pairs or properties\\nthat we can access using the dot notation let me prove that to you so\\nhere on the console let's look at the type of selected colors so the type of\\nthis array is an object so an array is an object in JavaScript so here on line\\n4 we can look at the properties of this array or this object using the dot\\nnotation look these are all the properties defined in arrays in\\nJavaScript so every time we declare an array using square brackets that array\\nwill automatically receive these properties we didn't explicitly define\\nthem they're just somehow magically inherited from somewhere else we're\\ngoing to learn about that later when we talk about prototypes now in this\\nlecture we're going to look at one of these properties that is the length\\nproperty this property returns the number of items or elements in an array\\nso save the changes you can see we have three elements in this array now later\\nin the course we have a comprehensive section about arrays you'll learn about\\nall kinds of operations we can perform on arrays for now all I want you to take\\naway is that an array is a data structure that we use to represent a\\nlist of items in the category of reference types you\\nhave learned about objects and arrays now let's take a look at functions\\nfunctions are one of the fundamental building blocks in JavaScript a function\\nis basically a set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value\\nlet me show you a couple of examples so I'm going to declare a function using\\nthe function keyword now we need to give it a name let's call that greet after\\nthat we need to add parentheses that's part of the syntax for declaring\\nfunctions and then curly braces now what we have here inside the curly braces is\\nwhat we refer to as the body of this function and this is where we add all\\nthese statements to define some kind of logic in our application for example the\\nlogic for this function should be to display a message on the console so here\\nwe can add console the log hello world now note that here we have a statement\\nso we terminated with a semicolon but when we are declaring a function we\\ndon't need to add semicolon at the end because we are not declaring it like a\\nvariable like this okay this is a function declaration right so now we\\nhave a function we can call this function like this so we add the name of\\nthe function and parentheses again and then semicolon to indicate that this is\\na statement save the changes now we have hello world on the console but that's\\npretty boring what would we do this let me show you how to make this more\\ninteresting our functions can have inputs and these inputs can change how\\nthe function behaves so let's say instead of displaying hello world we\\nwant to display the name of the person here like hello John so we can add a\\nvariable here in between parentheses we refer to this variable as a parameter\\nso this greet function has one parameter called name and essentially name is like\\na variable that is only meaningful inside\\ndysfunction so inside of this function we can work with this name variable but\\nit will not be accessible outside of this function the name is an input to\\nthis function so instead of displaying hello world we can display hello\\nthen add a plus here to concatenate two strings so we can add name after now\\nwhen calling the great function we need to pass a value for the name variable or\\nname parameter more accurately so we can pass John here now we refer to this as\\nan argument so John is an argument to the greet function a name is a parameter\\nof the greet function it's one of the things that a lot of programmers don't\\nknow they don't know the difference between a parameter and an argument so a\\nparameter is what we have here at the time of declaration but the argument is\\nthe actual value with supply for that parameter okay\\nnow let's save the changes so we have hello John now we can reuse this\\nfunction but with a different input so we can copy this line here and change on\\nto Mary save the changes now we have two different messages on the console now a\\nfunction can have multiple parameters so here we can separate parameters using a\\ncomma so let's add another parameter like last name now we can change our\\nconsole not blog add a space here and then display the last name\\nnow when calling this great function we should pass another argument for the\\nlast name right but let's see what happens if we don't do this so I'm gonna\\nsave the changes see what we got hello John undefined\\nbecause as I told you before the default value of variables in JavaScript is\\nundefined so because we did not pass a value for the last name by default it's\\nundefined so I'm gonna pass another argument here we separate them using a\\ncomma John Smith and we don't need the second call to the\\ngreet function save the changes now we have hello John Smith now there is a cleaner way to write this\\ncode on line three all these concatenations are kind of\\nugly they're getting in the way later in the course I'll show you how to use\\ntemplate literals to clean up this code for now don't worry about it let's look\\nat another example of a function so this function we have here is performing a\\ntask so performing a task is task is to display something on the console but\\nsometimes our functions might calculate something so here is an example of a\\nfunction that calculates a value so again function let's call this function\\nsquare this function should take a parameter let's call that number now we\\nneed to calculate the square of that number that is number times number just\\nbasic math right now we need to return this value to whoever is calling this\\nfunction for that we use the return keyword that's another reserved keyword\\nso you cannot have a variable called return okay now instead of calling the\\ngreet function let's call the square function so square we pass two now this\\nreturns a value so we can use that value to initialize a variable for example we\\ncan declare another variable called number and set it to a square of 2 and\\nthen we can display that on the console save the changes so we get 4 now in this\\nparticular example we don't necessarily have to declare a separate variable if\\nall we want to do is to display the square of 2 on the console we can\\nexclude this variable declaration and simply pass square of 2 to console.log\\nso when the JavaScript engine execute this code first is going to call this\\nfunction it would get a value and then pass that value to console dot lock\\nlet's save the changes and look we still get 4 now I have a question for you how\\nmany function calls do you think we have in this code we have to function costs\\nsquare of two is one function call let me delete this temporarily but consult\\nthat lock is also another function call right because here we have parentheses\\nso recalling the log function which is defined somewhere and passing an\\nargument we can pass a simple string like hello or we can pass an expression\\nthat expression can be a call to another function like square of two okay so this\\nis the basics of functions again later in the course we have a comprehensive\\nsection about functions for now all I want you to take away is that a function\\nis a set of statements that either performs a task or calculate and returns\\na value a real world application is essentially a collection of hundreds or\\nthousands of functions working together to provide the functionality of that\\napplication hi there it's me mosh again you seem to\\nbe very enthusiastic about learning JavaScript so I want to congratulate you\\nfor your determination for learning if you want to learn more from me I highly\\nencourage you to enroll in my JavaScript course you can watch this course online\\nor offline as many times as you want at your own pace the course comes with\\nplenty of exercises and solutions and you will also receive a certificate of\\ncompletion by the end of watching the course in case you're interested the\\nlink is in the video description have a great day and I hope to see you in the\\ncourse\""
